Welcome to our project repository! Below are the links to access different projects within this repository:

## Projects:

1. [Blur Loding](https://css-50-days-50-projects.vercel.app/Blur%20Loding/index.html): I've created a smooth transition from a blurred image to a clear screen when the page is loading. This project aims to enhance the user experience by providing an engaging visual effect during the loading process.
2. [Expanding_cards](https://css-50-days-50-projects.vercel.app/Expanding_cards/index.html): In this project, I've implemented a feature that expands image cards when the user places their mouse cursor over them. This expansion reveals a larger version of the image or additional details associated with the card. The expansion effect is achieved using CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling, providing a smooth and interactive experience for users.
